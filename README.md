# MCAO-Model

## Description
The MCAO (Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion) model is a rat model of ischemic stroke, widely used in research on stroke and neuroprotective therapies. In this model, cerebral ischemia is induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery (MCA), leading to the ischemia of brain areas typically perfused by this artery. This results in brain tissue damage, similar to ischemic stroke in humans.
